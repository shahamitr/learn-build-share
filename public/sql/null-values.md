# SQL NULL Values

A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

**Note:** A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

## How to Test for NULL Values?

It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as `=`, `<`, or `<>`.

We will have to use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators instead.

### IS NULL Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

### IS NOT NULL Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

## Example

The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field:

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NULL;
```

The following SQL lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field:

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;
```
